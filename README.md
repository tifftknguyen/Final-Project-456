In this project, we made two Deep Learning models training on Natural Image Data Set from Kaggle. We want to compare the accuracy of the Fully Connected vs CNN model and see the efficiency contrast. We used our class notes to implement and train our models, using batch normalization, dropout, and data augmentation to ensure regularization and optimization.
